Tinder-Clone made with Spring Boot, React, and OllamaChat

This project was created by me (Raul Precechan Nunes) with the purpose of practicing my programming skills using the tools mentioned at the beginning, especially the Spring Boot framework.

The system is divided into two main parts:

    The user interface, made with React to run in a browser.
    The Spring framework server, which manages user requests with the MongoDB database and the Ollama Chat AI.

To use MongoDB, I decided to use a Docker container to create a more modular approach, making integration easier.

The AI Chat I used is the open-source Ollama Chat, which is available for everyone to download for free on the project's official site.

This project is completely free for anyone who wants to use it for any legal purpose.
